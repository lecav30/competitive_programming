Explanation:

You only need the substring to have an even number of any character.
The statement doesn't request that the substring be palindrome.
Also the statement doesn't say the maximun amount of the substring, so you can take
the entire string and this will be fine.
Considering the above, you only need to count the number of characters and
almost only a amount of characters is odd, you can never find a solution.
