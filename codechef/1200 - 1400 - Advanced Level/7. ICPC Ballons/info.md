Explanation:

Main 1:
You have to know when you solve all the problems from 1 to 7.
To know that I create a vector to store the case when a problem from 1 to 7
is solved. And I break the loop when the count of is 7,
in other words when all the problems from 1 to 7 are solved.

Main 2:
In this case you do something similar to the before solution. But in this
case you doesn't need to save when a problem is solved, you only save the
last position when you solve a problem from 1 to 7.
